# Complex Embedded System: Smart Watch
# Components:
* Power Management IC: A power management integrated circuit (PMIC) is used to manage power on an electronic devices or in modules on devices that may have a range of voltages. The PMIC manages battery power charging and sleep modes, DC-to-DC conversion, scaling of voltages down or up
* MCU: A microcontroller contains one or more CPUs (processor cores) along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals.
* Pulse Sensor: Pulse sensors use the photoelectric method. ... Transmission types measure pulse waves by emitting red or infrared light from the body surface and detecting the change in blood flow during heart beats as a change in the amount of light transmitted through the body.
* Accelerometor: Accelerometer sensors are ICs that measure acceleration, which is the change in speed (velocity) per unit time
* Interface Bridge: The bridge interface is a function that accommodates multiple interfaces in one virtual interface and bridges those interfaces. Each accommodated interface connected to a physical segment is handled as one segment.
* Flash Memory: Flash memory is an electronic non-volatile computer memory storage medium that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed.
* Load SW IC: The load switch IC is connected between the power supply and the load (IC or LSI). It is a power management IC that reduces power consumption by controlling on/off of power supply lines supplied to ICs and LSIs depending on the operating mode of the system
