# Components:
* Push Button(Power UP): It is a type of switch work on simple mechanism push to start.
* Voltage Regulator: A voltage regulator is a system designed to automatically maintain a constant voltage.
* LM35 Temperature Sensor: Temperature sensors is the voltage across the diode terminals. If the voltage increases, the temperature also rises, followed by a voltage drop between the transistor terminals of base and emitter in a diode.
* Microcontroller: AT89C51 Microcontroller
* LCD Display: For display purpose
* Relay: A electrically operated switch.
* Buzzer: An audio signaling device.
* Memory Chip: A memory chip is an integrated circuit made out of millions of capacitors and transistors that can store data or can be used to process code.
* ADC0804
* Preset
