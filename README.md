* Working:the temperature of the sole-plate attains a predefined value then the heating action gets stopped automatically. And when the temperature falls below a certain specified value then again heating starts inside it.
* Thermostat: Device that controls the temperature in a house or machine by switching the heat on and off as necessary.
* Heating Element: The heating element consists of nichrome wire wound around a sheet of mica.
* User Inputs: Potentiometer is used for adjusting the desired temperature.
* Status Indicator: An LED is connected to the heating element to indicate active heating status.
