# Case Study
* Automatic Electric Iron
* An automatic electric iron consists of a thermostat that acts as a controller of the system, a resistive heating element is present that generates heat.
## Block Diagram

* Working:the temperature of the sole-plate attains a predefined value then the heating action gets stopped automatically. And when the temperature falls below a certain specified value then again heating starts inside it.
* Reference Input:
* Thermostat(Controller):
* Heating Element(Actuator):
* Sole Plate of Iron(Process):
* Controlled Output:
