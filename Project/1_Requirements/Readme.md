# Project
# Digital Watch with built-in Temperature Display
## Features:
* Displays Time in DD/MM/YYYY format, Temperature in Celsius degree.
## Description:
* This project focuses on creating an embedded system design of digital watch with built-in temperature Display.
* This project can be done in two ways:
* Using Micro Controller
* Using Arduino
## Objective:
* To make an embedded circuit and implement it using SimulIde.
## Components:
## Using Micro Controller
* Push Button(Power UP): It is a type of switch work on simple mechanism push to start.
* Voltage Regulator: A voltage regulator is a system designed to automatically maintain a constant voltage.
* Temperature Sensor: Temperature sensors is the voltage across the diode terminals. If the voltage increases, the temperature also rises, followed by a voltage drop between the transistor terminals of base and emitter in a diode.
* Microcontroller: 8051 Microcontroller
* LCD Display: For display purpose
* Relay: A electrically operated switch.
* Buzzer: An audio signaling device.
* Memory Chip: A memory chip is an integrated circuit made out of millions of capacitors and transistors that can store data or can be used to process the code.
## Using Arduino
* Arduino Uno R3
* Potentiometer
* LCD 16x2
* Temperature Sensor [TMP36]
# Requirements:
* High Level Requirements:

|  ID  |  Description  |
| ------  | ------  |
|  HLR1  |  LCD for displaying time, temperature  | 
|  HLR2  |  Setting time  |
|  HLR3  |  Power Source  |

* Low Level Requirements:

|  ID  |  Description  |
|  ------  |  ------  |
|  LLR1  |  Battery Backup  |
|  LLR2  |  Time Format Adjustment  |
|  LLR3  |  Temperature Adjustment  |

## Further Development:
* We can extend this project features by adding humidity, Air Quality display and even upgrade this into automatic light system and Visitor Counter System.
* For displaying Humidity we can use Hygrometer 
* For displaying Air Quality we can use Optical sensors, Metal Oxide Sesnor(To measure Nitrogen, Oxygen and Carbondioxide),Photo Ionization Sensor.
* For Visitor Counter we can use Ultra Sonic Sensor.
* For Automatic Light Sytem we can PIR Sensor. 

## SWOT Analysis:
* Strenghts: Displays temperature and time

* Weakness: Displays temperature in only one degree i.e., Celsius

* Oppurtunities: Can be extended for displaying Humidity, Air Quality etc.

* Threats: No major threats

## 4W's & 1H:
* Who: Can be used by every person
* What: Displays time and Temperature
* When: Utilized 24/7 everywhere
* Where: House, Offices
* How: Setting the timezone
