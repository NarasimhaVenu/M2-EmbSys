# Project
# Digital Watch with built-in Temperature Display
## Description:
* This peoject focuses on creating an embedded system design of digital watch with built-in temperature Display.
## Objective:
* To make an embedded circuit and implement it using SimulIde.
## Components:
* Push Button(Power UP): It is a type of switch work on simple mechanism push to start.
* Voltage Regulator: A voltage regulator is a system designed to automatically maintain a constant voltage.
* Temperature Sensor: Temperature sensors is the voltage across the diode terminals. If the voltage increases, the temperature also rises, followed by a voltage drop between the transistor terminals of base and emitter in a diode.
* Microcontroller: 8051 Microcontroller
* LCD Display: For display purpose
* Relay: A electrically operated switch.
* Buzzer: An audio signaling device.
* Memory Chip: A memory chip is an integrated circuit made out of millions of capacitors and transistors that can store data or can be used to process code.
