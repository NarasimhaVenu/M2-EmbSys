# Project
# Alaram Countdown using Arduino in SimulIde
## Features:
* Displays countdown which trigerrs the buzzer alarm.
* After entering the correct password the buzzer will be deactivated.
## Description:
* This project focuses on developing an Alarm Arduino Uno circuit, with a buzzer sound with a 10 seconds countdown, user needs to enter the correct password to deactivate the connection and to turn off the alarm.
## Objective:
* To make an Alarm circuit using Arduino and to implement it using SimulIde.
## Components:
* Arduino Uno 45
* 16x2 LCD Display Hd44780
* 4x3 Numeric Keypad
* Buzzer
* Power source
* LED
* Resistor
## Requirements:
* High Level Requirements:

|  ID  |  Description  |
| ------  | ------  |
|  HLR1  |  Knowledge of Arduino  | 
|  HLR2  |  Writing the code  |
|  HLR3  |  Making the Circuit  |

* Low Level Requirements:

|  ID  |  Description  |
|  ------  |  ------  |
|  LLR1  |  Knowledge of Components   |
|  LLR2  |  Adding necessary library files in Arduino  |
|  LLR3  |  Implimenting circuit in Simu Ide  |

## Further Development:
* We can extend this project features by adding humidity, Air Quality display and even upgrade this into automatic light system and Visitor Counter System.
* For displaying Humidity we can use Hygrometer 
* For displaying Air Quality we can use Optical sensors, Metal Oxide Sesnor(To measure Nitrogen, Oxygen and Carbondioxide),Photo Ionization Sensor.
* For Visitor Counter we can use Ultra Sonic Sensor.
* For Automatic Light Sytem we can PIR Sensor. 

## SWOT Analysis:
* Strenghts: Count down alarm

* Weakness: If the user enters wrong password buzzer wont go off, there is no reset option. 

* Oppurtunities: Can be extended for displaying Humidity, Air Quality etc.

* Threats: No major threats

## 4W's & 1H:
* Who: Can be used by every person
* What: For calculating countdown
* When: Can be utilized when a person needs an alarm.
* Where: House, Offices
* How: By using Arduino and other components.
