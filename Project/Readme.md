# Project
# Count down Alarm Clock with password enabled display using Arduino
## Features:
* Displays countdown which trigerrs the buzzer alarm.
* After entering the correct password the buzzer will be deactivated.
## Description:
* This project focuses on developing an Alarm Arduino Uno circuit, with a buzzer sound with a 10 seconds countdown, user needs to enter the correct password to deactivate the connection and to turn off the alarm.
* If the password i.e., # or *1234# is entered LCD will display Correct Pass
* If the password is not entered within time limit the buzzer will be triggered
* If the password i.e, * 1234*# is entered LCD will display Wrong Pass
## Objective:
* To make an Alarm circuit using Arduino and to implement it using SimulIde.
